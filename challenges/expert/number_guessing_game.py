# create a function named 'game' that implements a number guessing game. The function should
# set a random number within a range as the answer, then ask the player for a number and tell
# the player if the guess was "too high" or "too low". Also, it should count the number of guesses.
# 
# If the player guess the correct number, the game will finish by telling the player how many tries
# was used. 
#
# Hint: input() function and import random
#
# Bonus: if the player does not guess a number, the program should not crash and instead give
# the player a message to try and guess again but with a number this time.
