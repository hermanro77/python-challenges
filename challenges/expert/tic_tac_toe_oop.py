# Implement the game TicTacToe. Create a class TicTacToe that can keep a state of who's turn it is.
# It should also keep a record of the board's state after each turn.
# the board state should be printet after each turn and you need to check if there is a winner or a tie.
# If the game is over, ask if they want to play again. If answer is yes. Restart the game. 
#
# Sample usage:
# game = TicTacToe() This will initialize the board and player state
# game.start() This will start the game and take inputs from the players that change the board state
