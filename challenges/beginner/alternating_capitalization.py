# Define a function called alternating_capitalization that takes in a string, 
# and returns a matching string where every even letter is uppercase, and 
# every odd letter is lowercase. 
# 
# Assume only letters, and don't worry about spaces, numbers, or punctuation. 
# You can start with either upper or lowercase, as long as they alternate 
# 
# (ex: worldly become wOrLdLy)

def alternating_capitalization(word):
	pass
