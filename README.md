### Python Challenges
These are some small Python challenges. 
They in the problem in the challenges folder. 
The solution can be found in the .solution folder. 
Furthermore, all challenges can be tested via unit tests.

### Testing
`python main.py` will run all unit tests for all challenges at once.

#### With Intellij
If you want to run the test specifically for one challenge after implementing your solution you can run the tests in intellij from the interface by clicking the green execute test button in the file.

#### Other IDEs
If you are using another IDE than Intellij the following approach is recommended:

Make sure you have pip then install `pytest` with:

`pip install pytest`

Execute test with

`pytest path_to_test_to_execute.py`
